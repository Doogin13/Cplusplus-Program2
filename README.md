Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems. The Gaming Room wanted to improve software functionality and to expand to other software platforma. I kept this document clear, concise, and to the point.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helps in focusing on one part of the code at a time cutting down confusion of overlapping different parts of the code. Working on one part at a time allows for a clearer  concept of the operation.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the software requirements and stress the need for coud computing and serverless architecture.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it inportant to consider the user's needs when designing?
I took the concept of the game as given by the client and kept it the same. I tried to keep the code clear from the user's standpoint because if it is difficult for the user to maneuver, the application falters.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies wouyld you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I focused on clear and concise documentation for designing  software. I would try to better analyze the user's needs and constraints in designing a similar software application.
